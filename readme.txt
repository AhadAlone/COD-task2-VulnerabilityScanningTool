1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your script is located.
2. Run the chmod command to give execution permissions to your script:
        chmod +x password_checker.py
   This command changes the mode of the file to be executable.
3. Now, you can run your script directly from the terminal by typing:
        ./vulnerabilityScanning.py
If youâ€™re in the same directory as the script.
