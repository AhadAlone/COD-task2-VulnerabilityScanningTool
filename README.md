## Vulnerability Scanning Tool

### Overview

This Python-based vulnerability scanning tool is designed to scan a network or website for common security vulnerabilities such as open ports, outdated software versions, and misconfigurations. The tool performs the following actions:

1. **Port Scanning**: Identifies open ports on a specified IP address.
2. **Software Version Detection**: Extracts software version information from HTTP headers of a given URL.
3. **Misconfiguration Check**: Checks if directory listing is enabled on the web server.

### Features

- **Port Scanning**: Scans a range of ports on a specified IP address to identify open ports.
- **Software Version Detection**: Retrieves and displays server and X-Powered-By headers from HTTP responses to identify software versions.
- **Directory Listing Check**: Verifies if directory listing is enabled on the server by attempting to access a test directory.
